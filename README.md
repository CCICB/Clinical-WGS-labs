# Clinical WGS laboratories database

This is a resource to keep track of the growing number of laboratories offering clinical whole genome sequencing. These are generally through ISO15189 clincial accreditation, or offered by laboratatories with CLIA/CAP accreditation. If your lab is missing, feel free to let me know.
